Rethinking Abdominal Organ Segmentation (RAOS) in the clinical scenario: A robustness evaluation benchmark with challenging cases.
* This dataset consists of 413 real clinical ct scans and 413x9 MR scans, all 19 organs were annotated by an senoir oncologist (MD. Wenjun Liao, 10 years experient).
* There are some challenging cases in clinical practice, which can help to evaluate the generalization and robustness of deep learning methods.
* Some organ annotations not present in previous public datasets (such as prostate, seminal vesicles and etc).
